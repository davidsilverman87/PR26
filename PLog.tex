\subsection{Fock space and Field operators}

\textbf{Physical meaning.}  
\(\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}\) is the Hilbert space describing \(N\) identical fermions built from a one-particle Hilbert space \(\mathcal H_1\). A vector in \(\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}\) encodes all probability amplitudes for finding the \(N\) fermions in arbitrary one-particle states, with the fermionic exchange sign built in. Fermionic Fock space collects all such \(N\)-particle sectors into a single Hilbert space.

\textbf{Mathematical definitions.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Permutation operators.}  
Let \(\mathcal H_1\) be a complex separable Hilbert space and let \(\mathcal H_1^{\otimes N}\) be its \(N\)-fold tensor product.  
For each permutation \(\pi \in S_N\), define a linear operator
\[
P_\pi : \mathcal H_1^{\otimes N} \to \mathcal H_1^{\otimes N}
\]
by its action on simple tensors,
\[
P_\pi(\phi_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \phi_N)
= \phi_{\pi^{-1}(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes \phi_{\pi^{-1}(N)},
\]
extended by linearity and continuity.

\item \textbf{Antisymmetrizer and its range.}  
Define the antisymmetrization operator
\[
A_N \equiv \frac{1}{N!}\sum_{\pi \in S_N} \mathrm{sgn}(\pi)\, P_\pi .
\]
The range of \(A_N\), denoted \(\mathrm{Ran}(A_N)\), is
\[
\mathrm{Ran}(A_N)
\equiv
\{\, A_N \Phi \mid \Phi \in \mathcal H_1^{\otimes N} \,\}.
\]
Since \(A_N^2 = A_N\) and \(A_N^\dagger = A_N\), \(\mathrm{Ran}(A_N)\) is a closed subspace of \(\mathcal H_1^{\otimes N}\).

\item \textbf{Fermionic \(N\)-particle Hilbert space.}  
The fermionic \(N\)-particle Hilbert space is defined as
\[
\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N} \equiv \mathrm{Ran}(A_N).
\]
Equivalently,
\[
\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}
=
\left\{
\Psi \in \mathcal H_1^{\otimes N}
\;\middle|\;
P_\pi \Psi = \mathrm{sgn}(\pi)\,\Psi
\ \text{for all } \pi \in S_N
\right\}.
\]

\item \textbf{Combining one-particle states.}  
Given \(\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_N \in \mathcal H_1\), the corresponding \\ fermionic \(N\)-particle state is
\[
\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_N
\equiv
A_N(\phi_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \phi_N).
\]
This vector lies in \(\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}\) and changes sign under exchange of any two factors.

\item \textbf{Meaning of an \(N\)-particle state.}  
For any \(\Psi \in \mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}\) and any \(\chi_1,\ldots,\chi_N \in \mathcal H_1\), the complex number
\[
\langle \chi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \chi_N , \Psi \rangle
\]
is interpreted as the probability amplitude that the \(N\) fermions occupy the one-particle states \(\chi_1,\ldots,\chi_N\).

\item \textbf{Algebraic sum and direct sum.}  
Consider the algebraic sum
\[
\sum_{N=0}^\infty \mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}
=
\left\{
\sum_{k=1}^m \Psi^{(N_k)}
\;\middle|\;
\Psi^{(N_k)} \in \mathcal H_1^{\wedge N_k},\ m<\infty
\right\}.
\]
This sum is direct because
\[
\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N} \cap \mathcal H_1^{\wedge M} = \{0\}
\quad \text{for } N \neq M .
\]

\item \textbf{Fermionic Fock space.}  
The fermionic Fock space is the Hilbert-space completion of this direct sum:
\[
\mathcal F \equiv \bigoplus_{N=0}^\infty \mathcal H_1^{\wedge N},
\]
with inner product
\[
\langle \Psi, \Phi \rangle
=
\sum_{N=0}^\infty
\langle \Psi^{(N)}, \Phi^{(N)} \rangle_{\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}},
\quad
\Psi = \oplus_N \Psi^{(N)},\ 
\Phi = \oplus_N \Phi^{(N)}.
\]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{F2. Field operators on fermionic Fock space}


\subsubsection*{F2-1 Configuration-space representation, probability interpretation, and antisymmetry}

An element \(\Psi^{(N)}\in\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}\) admits a coordinate–spin representation
\[
\Psi^{(N)}(x_1,\dots,x_N),
\qquad x_i=(\mathbf r_i,\sigma_i)\in\mathbb R^3\times\{\uparrow,\downarrow\},
\]
which is a complex-valued function on the \(N\)-particle configuration space
\((\mathbb R^3\times\{\uparrow,\downarrow\})^N\).

For any measurable region \(\Omega\) of this configuration space,
\[
\int_\Omega |\Psi^{(N)}(x_1,\dots,x_N)|^2\,dx_1\cdots dx_N
\]
is the probability of finding the \(N\) identical fermions with coordinates and spins in \(\Omega\).

Because the fermions are physically identical, \(\Psi^{(N)}\) satisfies the antisymmetry condition
\[
\Psi^{(N)}(x_{\pi(1)},\dots,x_{\pi(N)})
=
\mathrm{sgn}(\pi)\,\Psi^{(N)}(x_1,\dots,x_N)
\quad\text{for all }\pi\in S_N,
\]
which is the coordinate-space representation of the abstract relation
\(P_\pi\Psi^{(N)}=\mathrm{sgn}(\pi)\Psi^{(N)}\).
This antisymmetry leaves probabilities invariant while encoding fermionic exchange at the level of amplitudes.

\subsubsection*{F2-2 Definition of annihilation and creation operators and induced field operators}

For each \(f\in L^2(\mathbb R^3)\) and spin \(\sigma\in\{\uparrow,\downarrow\}\), define the annihilation operator
\[
\psi_\sigma(f):\mathcal H_1^{\wedge N}\to\mathcal H_1^{\wedge(N-1)}
\]
by
\[
(\psi_\sigma(f)\Psi)^{(N-1)}(x_2,\dots,x_N)
=
\sqrt{N}\int_{\mathbb R^3} d\mathbf r\;
f(\mathbf r)\,
\Psi^{(N)}\big((\mathbf r,\sigma),x_2,\dots,x_N\big),
\]
and define the creation operator \(\psi_\sigma^\dagger(f)\) as the Hilbert-space adjoint of \(\psi_\sigma(f)\).

The map \(f\mapsto\psi_\sigma(f)\) is linear in \(f\), and the map
\(f\mapsto\psi_\sigma^\dagger(f)\) is antilinear. Accordingly, there exist operator-valued distributions
\(\psi_\sigma(\mathbf r)\) and \(\psi_\sigma^\dagger(\mathbf r)\) such that
\[
\psi_\sigma(f)
=
\int_{\mathbb R^3} d\mathbf r\; f(\mathbf r)\,\psi_\sigma(\mathbf r),
\qquad
\psi_\sigma^\dagger(f)
=
\int_{\mathbb R^3} d\mathbf r\; f^*(\mathbf r)\,\psi_\sigma^\dagger(\mathbf r).
\]
These relations express the integral representation of the linear dependence of
\(\psi_\sigma(f)\) and \(\psi_\sigma^\dagger(f)\) on the test function \(f\).

\subsubsection*{F2-3 Particle indistinguishability and slot independence}

Because \(\Psi^{(N)}\) is antisymmetric, the definition of \(\psi_\sigma(f)\) is independent of which coordinate slot is integrated over: integrating over any one slot yields the same \((N-1)\)-particle state up to the sign already fixed by antisymmetry. Thus \(\psi_\sigma(f)\) does not remove a distinguished particle but removes one fermion in the one-particle state specified by \((f,\sigma)\).

\subsubsection*{F2-4 Conditional interpretation of the reduced state}

For any region \(\Omega_{N-1}\subset(\mathbb R^3\times\{\uparrow,\downarrow\})^{N-1}\),
\[
\int_{\Omega_{N-1}}
|(\psi_\sigma(f)\Psi)^{(N-1)}(x_2,\dots,x_N)|^2
\,dx_2\cdots dx_N
\]
is the probability density for finding the remaining \(N-1\) fermions in \(\Omega_{N-1}\),
conditional on one fermion being in the one-particle state \((f,\sigma)\).

\subsubsection*{F2-5 Canonical anticommutation relations}

The field operators satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations
\[
\{\psi_\sigma(\mathbf r),\psi_{\sigma'}^\dagger(\mathbf r')\}
=
\delta_{\sigma\sigma'}\,\delta(\mathbf r-\mathbf r'),
\qquad
\{\psi_\sigma(\mathbf r),\psi_{\sigma'}(\mathbf r')\}=0,
\qquad
\{\psi_\sigma^\dagger(\mathbf r),\psi_{\sigma'}^\dagger(\mathbf r')\}=0,
\]
to be interpreted after smearing with test functions.

Equivalently, for smeared operators,
\[
\{\psi_\sigma(f),\psi_{\sigma'}^\dagger(g)\}
=
\delta_{\sigma\sigma'}\,\langle f,g\rangle_{\mathcal H_1},
\]
where
\[
\langle f,g\rangle_{\mathcal H_1}
=
\int_{\mathbb R^3} d\mathbf r\; f^*(\mathbf r)g(\mathbf r)
\]
is the inner product on the one-particle Hilbert space.

This relation expresses the consistency condition that creating a fermion in a one-particle state and then testing for its presence returns precisely the overlap of those one-particle states, and nothing else.



%\subsection*{I. Mathematical and Structural Foundations}

%\begin{enumerate}

%\item \textbf{Tensor product structure.}  
%The many-body Hilbert space is constructed as a graded tensor product of one-particle Hilbert spaces, with fermionic antisymmetrization imposed.
%\begin{ques}
  %What is a tensor product of spaces? What does it mean that fermionic antisymmetrization is imposed? I understand that "swapping particles" must result in negation of the wave function, but what is the mathematical definition of "swapping particles" - I recall that with two particles, it is realized by negating the coordinate system, but am not sure how this extends to the tensor product and many particles. \end{ques}
  
  %\begin{ans}
    %I re-consulted my linear algebra textbook for the formal definition, and physically, the tensor product of states \(\phi\text{ and } \tau\) is the state of two particles where particle 1 is in state \(\phi\) and particle 2 is in state \(\tau\). \\
  %This is a tensor product of \(\mathcal{H}\) with itself, so swapping particles is simply permuting factors in the tensor product. Hence "anticommutativity" of the \(\otimes\) operator. \end{ans}
    %\begin{ques}
    %\(\psi(r_1,r_2)\) is shorthand for \(\psi_1(r) \otimes \psi_2(r)\)? But is then \(\psi(r_1,r_2)\) no longer a map from \(R^3\) to \(\C\), but rather from \(\R^6\) (not considering the spinor)? Is the "ansatz" wave function \(\tilde{\psi}\) a map from some huge configuration space, or just \(R^3\)? I guess if \(\psi\) represents a state for which the particle number is uncertain, then it would not even be certain what \(\psi \) is a map from. Perhaps the interpretation of wave functions as functions breaks down under the application of the tensor product, and meaning is only extracted through field operators.
  %\end{ques}
  %\begin{ques}
    %What is a graded tensor product? From what I read in LADR, it seems that given two vector spaces, there is just one way to take the tensor product: \(v \otimes w\) is the functional so that \((v \otimes w)(\phi, \tau) = \phi(v)\tau(w)\), and in this case, it is not clear that the tensor product is anticommuting. 
  %\end{ques}
 
%\item \textbf{Operator-valued distributions.}  
%Field operators $\psi(\mathbf r)$ and $\psi^\dagger(\mathbf r)$ are operator-valued distributions. Products at coincident points are only meaningful under integrals or suitable regularization.
%\begin{ques}
%Are coincident points just identical points?
%\end{ques}
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection*{II. Second Quantization: Formal Axioms}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\setcounter{enumi}{3}

%\item \textbf{Fermionic Fock space.}  
%The fermionic Fock space is constructed from the one-particle Hilbert space. The vacuum state $\lvert 0\rangle$ is annihilated by all annihilation operators.
%\begin{ques}
    %How is it constructed?
%\end{ques}

%\item \textbf{Canonical anticommutation relations (CAR).}
%\[
%\{\psi_\alpha(\mathbf r),\psi_\beta^\dagger(\mathbf r')\}
%= \delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta(\mathbf r-\mathbf r'), \qquad
%\{\psi,\psi\}=\{\psi^\dagger,\psi^\dagger\}=0.
%\]
%\begin{ques}
  %These are related to the fermionic particle swapping negation rules right? How?
%\end{ques}

%\item \textbf{Operator correspondence.}  
%One-body operators correspond to bilinear forms in field operators; two-body operators correspond to quartic forms. Normal ordering is defined relative to the vacuum.

%\begin{ques}
  %What is normal ordering?
%\end{ques}
%\item \textbf{Density and number operators.}
%\[
%\hat n(\mathbf r)=\sum_\alpha \psi_\alpha^\dagger(\mathbf r)\psi_\alpha(\mathbf r).
%\]
%This is taken as an operator identity. 
%\begin{ques}
  %\(\int_V \hat{n}(\mathbf{r}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\) is the expectation value for the number of particles in volume \(V\)? 
%\end{ques}
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection*{III. Microscopic Hamiltonian Assumptions}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\setcounter{enumi}{7}

%\item \textbf{Electronic Hamiltonian.}  
%The Hamiltonian consists of kinetic energy, an external potential, and an instantaneous two-body interaction. Spin indices are included explicitly; spin--orbit coupling is absent unless stated.

%\item \textbf{Attractive interaction channel.}  
%Only the interaction channel relevant for pairing is retained. This is a controlled truncation, not an identity.
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection*{IV. Statistical Mechanics Layer}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\setcounter{enumi}{9}

%\item \textbf{Grand canonical ensemble.}  
%The system is described in the grand canonical ensemble with chemical potential $\mu$ included in the Hamiltonian.

%\item \textbf{Thermodynamic limit.}  
%The limit $V\to\infty$ is taken prior to symmetry considerations, allowing inequivalent representations of the CAR.
%\begin{ques}
  %What is \(V\), and what are inequivalent representations of the CAR?
%\end{ques}

%\item \textbf{Expectation values.}  
%Expectation values $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denote ensemble averages in a chosen equilibrium state and yield c-numbers.
%\begin{ques}
  %What is a c-number?
%\end{ques}
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection*{V. Mean-Field / Saddle-Point Commitment}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\setcounter{enumi}{12}

%\item \textbf{Mean-field factorization.}  
%Quartic operator products may be approximated by bilinear terms plus c-number fields via a saddle-point approximation. 
%\begin{ques}
  %What is a saddle=point approximation, and why is this an axiom? Doesn't Svidzinsky go through this approximation somewhat carefully?
%\end{ques}

%\item \textbf{Order parameter definition.}
%\[
%\Delta(\mathbf r,\mathbf r')
%\equiv
%- V(\mathbf r-\mathbf r')
%\langle \psi_\downarrow(\mathbf r')\psi_\uparrow(\mathbf r)\rangle.
%\]
%This is a definition.
%\begin{ques}
%We're working over momentum states, not position states, so should these \(\mathbf{r}\) be replaced by \(\mathbf{k}\). If not, what does \(V(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')\) mean physically, considering particles are not localized?
%\end{ques}

%\item \textbf{Self-consistency condition.}  
%The mean field must equal the expectation value computed in the resulting quadratic Hamiltonian. 
%\begin{ques}
  %Define the mean field, expectation value of what?
%\end{ques}
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection*{VI. Symmetry-Breaking Commitments}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\setcounter{enumi}{15}

%\item \textbf{Broken $U(1)$ symmetry.}  
%Particle-number conservation is not enforced at the level of the effective Hamiltonian.
%\begin{ques}
  %Does this mean that the Hamiltonian can change the number of particles in the system? What would this even mean physically?
%\end{ques}

%\item \textbf{Anomalous averages.}  
%Expectation values of the form $\langle \psi\psi\rangle$ are permitted and nonzero in the chosen symmetry-broken sector. 
%\begin{ques}
  %What is a symmetry-broken sector? I assume \(\psi \) are the field operators. Why might these not be permitted? Permitted is a rather heuristic term.
%\end{ques}

%\item \textbf{Gauge fixing.}  
%A definite global phase of the order parameter is implicitly fixed. 
%\begin{ques}
  %What is a global phase, and what is an order parameter?
%\end{ques}
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection*{VII. Quadratic Fermionic Hamiltonians}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\setcounter{enumi}{18}

%\item \textbf{Quadratic Hamiltonians.}  
%Any fermionic Hamiltonian quadratic in field operators admits exact diagonalization.

%\item \textbf{Bogoliubov transformation.}  
%Diagonalization is achieved via a linear canonical transformation preserving the CAR.

%\item \textbf{Nambu formalism.}  
%Doubling of degrees of freedom is a bookkeeping device and introduces no new physical assumptions.
%\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Second Quantization}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \textbf{Fermionic modes and CAR.}
%For any single-particle label $a$ (e.g. $(\mathbf r,\sigma)$ or $(\mathbf k,\sigma)$),
%there exist operators $c_a, c_a^\dagger$ obeying
%$\{c_a,c_b^\dagger\}=\delta_{ab}$ and $\{c_a,c_b\}=\{c_a^\dagger,c_b^\dagger\}=0$.

%\item \textbf{Field operators as a basis change.}
%The real-space fields are linear combinations of mode operators:
%$\psi_\sigma(\mathbf r)=\sum_a \phi_a(\mathbf r,\sigma)\,c_a$,
%$\psi_\sigma^\dagger(\mathbf r)=\sum_a \phi_a^*(\mathbf r,\sigma)\,c_a^\dagger$,
%with $\{\psi_\sigma(\mathbf r),\psi_{\sigma'}^\dagger(\mathbf r')\}
%=\delta_{\sigma\sigma'}\delta(\mathbf r-\mathbf r')$.

%\item \textbf{Many-body Hamiltonians in second quantization.}
%One-body terms are quadratic in fields/modes; two-body terms are quartic.
%In particular, a contact interaction is
%\[
  %H_{\mathrm{int}}=g\int d\mathbf r\;
  %\psi_\uparrow^\dagger(\mathbf r)\psi_\downarrow^\dagger(\mathbf r)
  %\psi_\downarrow(\mathbf r)\psi_\uparrow(\mathbf r)
%\]

%\item \textbf{Grand-canonical ensemble as trace over Fock space.}
%Thermodynamics is encoded by
%$Z=\mathrm{Tr}\,e^{-\beta(H-\mu\hat N)}$,
%where $\hat N$ is the number operator.

%\item \textbf{Interaction picture in imaginary time.}
%Given $\mathcal H_0=H_0-\mu\hat N$, define
%$O(\tau)=e^{\tau\mathcal H_0}Oe^{-\tau\mathcal H_0}$,
%and the time-ordering operator $T_\tau$ orders operators by $\tau$.

%\item \textbf{Time-ordered exponential identity.}
%For an interaction $H_{\mathrm{int}}(\tau)$ in the interaction picture,
%$Z=\mathrm{Tr}\left\{e^{-\beta\mathcal H_0}\,
%T_\tau\exp\left(-\int_0^\beta H_{\mathrm{int}}(\tau)\,d\tau\right)\right\}$.

%\item \textbf{Gaussian (Wick) property for quadratic fermions.}
%Thermal averages with respect to a quadratic Hamiltonian obey Wick’s theorem:
%time-ordered products reduce to sums of products of two-point contractions.

%\item \textbf{Hubbard--Stratonovich (HS) identity (operator form).}
%For an operator bilinear $L(\mathbf r,\tau)$,
%\[
%T_\tau e^{\int L^\dagger L}
%\propto
%\int D\zeta D\zeta^*\,
%e^{-\int |\zeta|^2}\,
%T_\tau e^{\int(L^\dagger\zeta+\zeta^*L)} .
%\]
%(Precise constants are fixed by normalization.)

%\item \textbf{Auxiliary pair field scaling.}
%If $L\propto \sqrt{|g|}$, then scaling $\zeta=|g|^{-1/2}\Delta$
%rewrites $Z$ as a functional integral over $\Delta(\mathbf r,\tau)$.

%\item \textbf{Saddle-point/mean-field principle.}
%When the functional integral is dominated by stationary configurations,
%$\Delta(\mathbf r,\tau)$ may be replaced by a stationary (often $\tau$-independent)
%field $\Delta(\mathbf r)$ determined by the stationarity condition.

%\item \textbf{Quadratic mean-field Hamiltonian.}
%At fixed $\Delta(\mathbf r)$ the fermionic problem is quadratic and can be written
%as
%\[
%H_{\mathrm{MF}}=
%\sum_{\sigma}\int \psi_\sigma^\dagger h_0 \psi_\sigma\,d\mathbf r
%+\int\left(\Delta\,\psi_\uparrow^\dagger\psi_\downarrow^\dagger
%+\Delta^*\,\psi_\downarrow\psi_\uparrow\right)\,d\mathbf r
%+\text{(c-number)}.
%\]

%\item \textbf{Bogoliubov--Valatin (canonical) transformation.}
%There exist quasiparticle operators $\gamma_n,\gamma_n^\dagger$
%(linear in $\psi,\psi^\dagger$) such that:
%(i) they satisfy CAR, and
%(ii) they diagonalize $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$.
%The CAR constraint implies the usual orthonormality/completeness relations
%for the coefficients $(u_n(\mathbf r),v_n(\mathbf r))$.

%\item \textbf{BdG eigenproblem from diagonalization.}
%Requiring that $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$ be diagonal in $\gamma_n^\dagger\gamma_n$
%yields a coupled linear eigenvalue problem for $(u_n,v_n)$
%(the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations), plus the self-consistency condition
%$\Delta(\mathbf r)=-g\langle \psi_\downarrow(\mathbf r)\psi_\uparrow(\mathbf r)\rangle$.
